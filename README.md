# Goal of Project

This data science project focuses on curating a thorough collection of issues reported by users of Payment Apps, centering on frequent challenges such as account management, transaction handling, and customer service, along with product, system, and feature malfunctions. It then delves into the emotional responses elicited by these challenges, analyzing sentiments expressed in user feedback, ranging from satisfaction and frustration to trust and dissatisfaction. By examining both the practical difficulties and the emotional reactions of Payment App users, specifically those using **PhonePe and Google Pay**, this project aims to offer an in-depth understanding of the overall user experience encountered on these platforms.
