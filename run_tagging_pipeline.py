Advertisements are running on that portion of screen and the choice is not clearly visible. It is suggested that this choice may be placed at the top or at a distinctly visible part of the screen where it is not cluttered by advertisements.', "I once made a payment to someone; it was a taxi; but it failed; the money didn't go into the receiver's account; it showed payment pending; but my account was debited; then payment again. done. It was successful. Then, after two or three days, it said that the pending payment was successful. I thought it would be credited to my account, but it was credited to the receiver's account. Money gone twice.... its genuineðŸ¥²the worst app ever..", "After this latest update, App stops working in some ways. Bill payment page not opening, just loading loading loading whereas my internet connectivity is much better ,every app just works fine. How someone is supposed to do complain it on app's help and support if chat with us option do not have any process for the same .It always shows queries for the successful payments only not ones which are not even initiated properly. That's worst experience ðŸ˜¤ 0 zero starsðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤", "One of the best payment apps, but I don't know why I'm facing too many issues nowadays. When I try to pay either the balance shows insufficient or the app shows some sort of technical error. I hope these issues get fixed soon.", 'I use paytm for some years now. But twice now it happened to me that the amount is deducted from my account, but other person saying not received as no paytm usage. From Paytm customer care the person is saying the confirmation from receiver whoc has not received through chat. I wanted to give the contact number of that person, but it seems I have to get confirmation...Two times now Rs 925 deducted from my account. Not at all happy wit service. Very much disappointed.', "Worst worst worst worst worst app. I made a payment of my credit card on 30 Oct and it failed after the money was debited from my account in the paytm app it shows unsuccessful but when I raise a query they take it as payment successful they technically stole my money. What is this ridiculous app. And when you try to contact them they don't have any contact options. Money has not been refunded yet and neither have they messaged or emailed me. No costumer support nothing!! Don't fall for this app", 'Not able to activate my wallet since a month now, it always throws error "something went wrong please try after some time", really frustrating experience, I am not able to access my own money. Please fix it on priority. & Yes the UI is horribly bad, you must fire your UI and User Experience team, the App is very complex and all over the place, except for important things you can find all sort of nonsense.', "The app is good but you never mentioned that without updating the app, we can't make transactions or check balance. I have been trying all day to pay but while trying to pay, there was an error message stating Error occurred and even while trying to check balance, same happens.. Try to fix this. Many would not know this.", "Worst experience. I have transferred money from paytm app through my credit card. It's got deducted but receiver didn't received any amount. And when I try to raise ticket so always it is showing some error msg ( due to technical issue we are unable to raise the issue) and when I connect with Paytm help centre on call so they are saying for payment regarding you need to raise ticket from app only. If it's showing technical issue so keep trying again and again. But how many more time.", "Though it's providing so many good features but. There are few things where it is bad at implementing, 1.Split bill history is not optimised: some payment not showing in split bill if it's 1 month or sometime 15 day old. Longer loading time for split bill history . 2. Pay button not disappearing at instant even after paying the amount. 3. Can't delete split payment ever if you are admin, though it is a security feature but it can display that this person has deleted this split bill"]
